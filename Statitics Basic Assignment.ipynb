    "### Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "- **Meaning:** Descriptive statistics are methods used to **summarize, organize, and present data** in a meaningful way.  \n",
    "- **Purpose:** To describe what the data shows without making predictions or generalizations.  \n",
    "- **Tools/Techniques:**  \n",
    "  - Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, Median, Mode  \n",
    "  - Measures of Dispersion: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation  \n",
    "  - Graphical methods: Pie charts, Histograms, Bar diagrams  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "Suppose we collected the marks of 50 students in a class.  \n",
    "- Average marks = 65  \n",
    "- Highest marks = 92  \n",
    "- Lowest marks = 32  \n",
    "- Graphical presentation: Histogram of marks distribution  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are just **describing** the data of 50 students, not making predictions about other classes or populations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inferential Statistics\n",
    "- **Meaning:** Inferential statistics are methods used to **make predictions, draw conclusions, or test hypotheses** about a larger population based on a sample of data.  \n",
    "- **Purpose:** To infer or generalize from a sample to a population.  \n",
    "- **Tools/Techniques:**  \n",
    "  - Hypothesis Testing (t-test, chi-square test, ANOVA)  \n",
    "  - Estimation (confidence intervals, standard error)  \n",
    "  - Regression and Correlation analysis  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "From the same class of 50 students, suppose we want to estimate the **average marks of all students in the school (say 1,000 students)**.  \n",
    "- We take a random sample of 50 students.  \n",
    "- Mean score of sample = 65  \n",
    "- Using inferential statistics, we estimate that the **average marks of all 1,000 students** will be around **65 ± 3** (with 95% confidence).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are not only describing the sample but also **drawing inferences about the whole population**.  \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Difference\n",
    "- **Descriptive statistics** → Describe and summarize **the data you have**.  \n",
    "- **Inferential statistics** → Use the data you have to make **conclusions or predictions about a larger population**.  \n"

    "Sampling in Statistics:\n",
    "Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals or observations from a larger population \n",
    "to estimate characteristics of the whole population.\n",
    "Since studying an entire population is often impractical or costly, sampling helps save time, money, and effort \n",
    "while still providing reliable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Sampling:\n",
    "- Every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected.\n",
    "- Example: Drawing 50 student names randomly from a school list of 1000 students.\n",
    "- Advantage: Reduces bias, simple to implement.\n",
    "- Limitation: May not represent subgroups of the population accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stratified Sampling:\n",
    "- The population is divided into subgroups (strata) based on shared characteristics (e.g., age, gender, income).\n",
    "- Random samples are then taken from each subgroup in proportion to its size in the population.\n",
    "- Example: Dividing students by grade level, then randomly selecting a proportionate number from each grade.\n",
    "- Advantage: Ensures all subgroups are represented, leading to more accurate and reliable results.\n",
    "- Limitation: Requires knowledge of population characteristics in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Difference:\n",
    "- Random sampling selects directly from the entire population.\n",
    "- Stratified sampling first divides the population into subgroups, then samples from each subgroup.\n",
